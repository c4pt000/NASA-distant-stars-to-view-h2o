# as a comparsion experiment to rule out "water"

if it floats in space the water stays sterile from contamination to really rule out that water is being measured when observed at a distance with spectroscopy equipment if that involves spectral analysis using a satellite in orbit of earth directed at a near by floating space probe of water maybe half the distance of the moon or less


# it should be far away off of the surface of mars at a distance on a floating space probe since mars has constiutents in the carbon dioxide atomsphere which could lead to false postives with observation of spectroscopy meausrements at a distance as a control to determine if water is the distant realms further in outer space with telescopes and astronomical equipment

nothing proves this as an experimental control


since not all distant stars might not all be fueled by hydrogen or helium nuclear plasmonic reactions
which would mean that not all planets or distant star systems form heavy elements in the same way in terms of core chemical elements known to earth similar to our chemical periodic table


since we haven't encountered water as h2o beyond the domain of this world nothing proves this except a proposed experiment to isolate a control


which would consist of a flat plate on mars about 20ft by 20ft viewable from earth

where the rover would be equipped with 80 gallons of water or more

to project a laser spectroscopy experiment from earth off of the platter of water 20ft by 20ft

to bounce back as a receiver for chemical spectral analysis at a distance

to isolate what h2o would verify as under observable galactic spectral analysis viewing the depths of outer space

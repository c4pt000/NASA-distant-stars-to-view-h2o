nothing proves this as an experimental control

since we haven't encountered water as h2o beyond the domain of this world nothing proves this except a proposed experiment to isolate a control


which would consist of a flat plate on mars about 20ft by 20ft viewable from earth

where the rover would be equipped with 80 gallons of water or more

to project a laser spectroscopy experiment from earth off of the platter of water 20ft by 20ft

to bounce back as a receiver for chemical spectrual analysis at a distance

to isolate what h2o would verify as under observable galactic spectrual analysis viewing the depths of outer space

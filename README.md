nothing proves this as an experimental control


since not all distant stars might not all be fueled by hydrogen or helium nuclear plasmonic reactions
which would mean that not all planets or distant star systems form heavy elements in the same way in terms of core chemical elements known to earth similar to our chemical periodic table


since we haven't encountered water as h2o beyond the domain of this world nothing proves this except a proposed experiment to isolate a control


which would consist of a flat plate on mars about 20ft by 20ft viewable from earth

where the rover would be equipped with 80 gallons of water or more

to project a laser spectroscopy experiment from earth off of the platter of water 20ft by 20ft

to bounce back as a receiver for chemical spectral analysis at a distance

to isolate what h2o would verify as under observable galactic spectral analysis viewing the depths of outer space

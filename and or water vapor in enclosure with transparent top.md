reproducible results first on earth from an elevation of 100ft through transparent enclosure

to confirm and avoid false positive of same exact control experiment on mars to reduce variables to verify h2o as a chemical 
structure remotely

by making water vapor in the enclosure for micro particulates of h2o in the water

this will be a secondary analysis of 80 gallons of water in a 20ft by 20ft by 2ft enclosure with extending top

the rover would have to make sure there are no leaks when filled
